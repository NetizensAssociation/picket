# Picket - Netizens' Association's Browser Extension

This project is a browser extension that allows unions to organize boycotts
and define their demands, while guaranteeing union members can participate
seamlessly. This is how it works:

1. Unions define their policies with a set of rules determining which websites
   break their goals. The unions can also organize timed boycotts (e.g.
   blocking a website for a given day).
1. Any netizen can browse through existing unions and decide which one best
   represent her.
1. The netizen then install this browser extension and feeds it the union policy
   file.
1. Every time she visits a website that is blocked, the extension will inform
   the website that a user from the given union has decided to boycott the
   website and she will not be using it today (she will see the union's message
   as to why). In case the website is not blocked, but still violates union
   rules, the netizen will see a warning banner as she browses.

## Project Structure
